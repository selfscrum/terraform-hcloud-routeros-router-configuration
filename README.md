# terraform-hcloud-routeros-router-configuration

Configures a Hetzner server with an RouterOS Router.

The Router should be prepared with the [terraform-hcloud-routeros-router](https://github.com/selfscrum/terraform-hcloud-routeros-router) provider but other routerOS routers can be addressed as well.
